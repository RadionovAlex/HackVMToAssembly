Rules:

1. R13 register in assembly will be used to understand 
where to go after function (standard or user-written) completion. 
So, before call the function, M[R13] need to be filled by the next raw after function call.
And after each function call, Jump to destionation from R13 need to be completed.

2. R14 can be used for the push constant. 
Push - as a separate command and R14 will conitans the value to write in the stack. 
So, before call the func, need to write in the M[R14] required value.

3. The order of functions is: 
   - standard ariphmetic and logic functions: 
    - add       x+y
    - sub       x-y
    - neg       -y
    - eq        true if x=y else false
    - gt        true if x>y else false
    - lt        true if x<y else false
    - and       x And y
    - or        x Or y
    - not       Not y
   - functions from .vm files
   
4. To correctly start a program: 
    - Before funtions declarations, @ProgramStart    +   0;JMP  should be called to skipp all functions calling
    - After functions declarations, (ProgramStart) symbol should be declared
